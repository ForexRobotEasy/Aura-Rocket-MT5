This is the code for the Aura Rocket MT5 Expert Advisor, developed by [forexroboteasy.com](https://forexroboteasy.com/).

## Product Description
Aura Rocket MT5 is an advanced forex software designed for professional traders. It utilizes a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) neural network and trend indicators to generate entry signals and manage trades. The expert advisor is fully customizable and allows for hyperparameter optimization to find the best settings for individual trading strategies.

With Aura Rocket MT5, traders can benefit from the following features:
- Multilayer Perceptron: The expert advisor uses a neural network with configurable input and hidden layers to predict market trends and generate accurate entry signals.
- Trend Indicators: Aura Rocket MT5 incorporates trend indicators to identify the direction of the market trend and filter out false signals.
- Stop Loss Mechanism: A stop loss mechanism is implemented to minimize losses and protect the trading capital.
- Hyperparameter Optimization: Traders can optimize the expert advisor's performance by fine-tuning the neural network's learning rate and momentum through a hyperparameter search.

## Code Explanation

The code is written in MQL5 and consists of several sections:

1. **Libraries and Constants**: The necessary libraries for trading, neural network, trend indicators, stop loss, and hyperparameter search are included. Global constants are defined.

2. **Global Variables**: Global variables are defined, including the trade object, Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), trend indicator, stop loss mechanism, and hyperparameter search object.

3. **Initialization**: The `OnInit()` function is called during expert advisor initialization. Trade parameters, MLP configuration, indicator initialization, and hyperparameter search setup are performed in this section.

4. **Main Logic**: The `OnTick()` function is called on every tick. It checks for a new bar and obtains the current trend direction. Depending on the trend direction, it generates an entry signal using the MLP and opens a buy or sell order if the signal meets certain criteria.

5. **Expert Advisor Termination**: The `OnDeinit()` function is called when the expert advisor is stopped. It performs cleanup operations, such as deinitializing the MLP, trend indicator, and stop loss mechanism.

6. **Optimization**: The `OnOptimization()` function is called when the expert advisor is optimized. It sets up the hyperparameter search space and starts the hyperparameter search process.

## Usage and Customization
To use the Aura Rocket MT5 Expert Advisor, follow these steps:

1. Install the Expert Advisor: Compile and install the expert advisor in your MetaTrader 5 platform.
2. Customize Trade Parameters: Adjust the trade parameters in the `OnInit()` function according to your trading preferences.
3. Configure MLP: Modify the MLP configuration in the `OnInit()` function to fit your trading strategy. You can change the number of input neurons, hidden neurons, and output neurons.
4. Set Up Indicators: Initialize and configure the trend indicator and stop loss mechanism in the `OnInit()` function based on your trading strategy.
5. Start Expert Advisor: Enable the expert advisor to start trading automatically. The `OnTick()` function will generate entry signals based on the MLP and execute trades accordingly.
6. Optimize Performance: Use the `OnOptimization()` function to fine-tune the MLP's learning rate and momentum through hyperparameter optimization.
